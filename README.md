Dragons Nest Gaming is a gamingstore in Norway I started together with my brothers. It started with my biggest brother who
sold Magic the Gathering cards on auction sites. All went well and they saw the intresset in the market in Stavanger there we lived and we started a pysical store there like minded could meet up. The store goes well and we sell some stuff through Facebook. But it is time for a E-commerce webpage so we can reach a bigger clientele. It is a business site that sells products to private custumers and it is singel payment.

### User Experience UX
  
  The plan for the site was to build a slim site that was easy for users to use and find what thay want. I also wanted to build a event calendar for the users that live close to the store so they could meet up. 
  The font name for the page is: K2D a slim but easy to read. 
  
#### Color Scheme

I choose to use limited color scheme of Orange #f29100, Black and White. I got the Orange color from the logo 
so it feels like everyting fits in. And with Black and white it is easy to make contrast. 

In some placees i used Green for succes/Add, Red for warning/delete to get a more user friendly experience.

#### Icons
I used icons from Font Awsome extensivley on the website. They are used within the nav bar to reduce the need for verbose descriptions such as 'search. I have used them on buttons to reinforce the action of the button.
