Dragons Nest Gaming is a gamingstore in Norway I started together with my brothers. It started with my biggest brother who
sold Magic the Gathering cards on auction sites. All went well and they saw the intresset in the market in Stavanger there we lived and we started a pysical store there like minded could meet up. The store goes well and we sell some stuff through Facebook. But it is time for a E-commerce webpage so we can reach a bigger clientele. It is a business site that sells products to private custumers and it is singel payment.
